## structure for the cluster

### 1 mode extraction

- fit the data into a shape that is most convenient for the extraction approaches
- PCA in MultiVariateStats.jl uses general matrix input
- DiffusionMap in ManifoldLearning.jl uses general matrix input
- output storage: log everything in individual run folders!
	
- question of window length: lets make a trial with the PCA, then check the SSA
	

### 2 differentiating properties

### 3 coupling model

# codework of work on dimensionality reduction methods SSA and NLSA on fluxnet series

## file contents

- toolbox.jl basic functionality
- struct_blockdata.jl object structures for dimensionality reduction
- iterate_blockdata.jl parallelized dimensionality reduction computations
- phase_comparison.jl further processing and plotting (very messy)
